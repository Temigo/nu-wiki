This wiki is a reference for how to access and utilize computing resources at SLAC, and is meant for the short/long baseline accelerator neutrino group at SLAC and collaborators.

Experienced members of SLAC neutrino group should actively participate to add more descriptions.
Yes, I am talking to you, Tracy. None of the below addresses your issue/question? You can try to harass [kazu](https://github.com/drinkingkazu).

## Getting started with SLAC computing (for everyone)
You can find the following info on this wiki after info is filled.
* [**Step 1: Computing account at SLAC**](/guides/account)
    * What are they? How to get them? What should you do first after getting accounts?

* [**Step 2: Computing resource summary**](/guides/resources)
    * This covers both neutrino dedicated and shared ones
    
* [**FYI: Singularity containers for ML group work**](/guides/containers)
    * Or docker, but not your lunch container.

## Buying and setting up a laptop/desktop (for SLAC members)

* [**Making "I want X" request**](/guides/request)(X = computing related)
    * How can I get my own laptop? a server? disk space for storage? network bandwidth to parallel download 100 movies? (don't)
* [**Building/Owning a Desktop**](/guides/building)
    * Still under construction. Your help/experience needed!
