This wiki is for the short/long baseline accelerator neutrino group! We apologize for calling ourselves neutrino group while there is also EXO group at SLAC, definitely a neutrino experiment, who probably publish more papers than we do. Since this wiki starts with an apology, you guessed it right: I am Japanese.

You can find the following info on this wiki after info is filled.
* [**Computing account at SLAC**](/guides/account)
    * What are they? How to get them? What should you do first after getting accounts?
* [**Making "I want X" request**](/guides/request)(X = computing related)
    * How can I get my own laptop? a server? disk space for storage? network bandwidth to parallel download 100 movies? (don't)
* [**Computing resource summary**](/guides/resources)
    * This covers both neutrino dedicated and shared ones
* [**Singularity containers for ML group work**](/guides/containers)
    * Or docker, but not your lunch container.
* [**Building/Owning a Desktop**](/guides/building)
    * Still under construction. Your help/experience needed!
* [**Instructions to setup and produce ICARUS data**](/guides/icarus)

Experienced members of SLAC neutrino group should actively participate to add more descriptions.
Yes, I am talking to you, Tracy.
