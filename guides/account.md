## Step 1: Getting your account

There are two types: **SLUO** and **computing** accounts. 

**SLUO** account is needed for all SLAC employees and users. You need this before applying for a computing account.

**Computing (Unix/Windows)** account is for all practical things including use of computing resources, emails, office apps, HR websites, travel requests/reports, IT service tickets and more. When you apply, make sure you apply to both. Unix account used to be used for all computing accounts, but as of Spring 2020 Windows account is used for authentification of SDF computing infrastructure, a main computing resource at SLAC.

### How to request an account?
* **Step 1.1**: request SLAC user account (called SLUO). I put [instructions here](/guides/sluo-howto). This may take some time (a few days to a week), so submit asap!
* **Step 1.2**: once the request is approved, you should receive an email notifying that and your "system ID". Contact [Kazu](mailto:kterao@slac.stanford.edu) with following information:
  * Your system ID
  * Name of your home institution
  * **TWO** preferred unix user account name to be created for you, in the order of preference. Your account name may contain digits 0-9, lower-case letters a-z, and the special character "-". Must begin with a lower-case letter a-z. Must not be shorter than 3 or longer than 8 characters.

### To-do's after getting an account
* Make sure you complete the cyber security training, or your account will be disabled soon.
* Go to [this page](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/comp/unix/auth/afs-self.shtml) and set your unix `$HOME` directory space quota to 20GB

### Configuring Email app
Here is the [link](http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/comp/messaging/Installing/default.htm) to see how to configure your SLAC email on apple Mail, Thunderbird, etc..

### SLAC VPN
VPN is needed when you want to use (some) printers and access management tools like peoplesoft. Most of you may not need these services, so don't bother unless you need them.
* Submit a VPN access request from [IT service desk](https://slacprod.servicenowservices.com/it_services)
* Download Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, connect to su-vpn.stanford.edu
