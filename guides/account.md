There are two types of accounts: **unix** and **windows**. 

**Unix** account is used to use computing resources at SLAC. It's the account you would use to ssh into computing nodes, submit grid jobs, etc. Usual stuffs!

**Windows** account is used for emails, scheduler apps, HR websites, travel request/report, IT service ticket, etc.. If you are a SLAC employee, you need this. If you are a non-SLAC collaborator, you might not need this.

## How to request Unix/Windows account?
Start your account request [here](https://oraweb4.slac.stanford.edu/apex/epnprod/f?p=134:1::::::)

## Unix $HOME quota (do this)
Once you have unix account, you can go to [this webpage](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/comp/unix/auth/afs-self.shtml) and request 20GB space in your `$HOME` space. Once you obtain your account, there are many unix/linux server machines you can log into. Most (if not all) machines share the same home directory via [afs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_File_System), and your home space is only 2GB (sad!). 

## Emails and Printers
SLAC provides Email service with an windows account (so don't bother if you have only unix account). A printer can be used by anyone as long as you figure out how to use it. Hopefully description below helps!
